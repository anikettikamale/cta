    <center click here> elephant are the largest existing land animals.
        Three living species are currently recognised: 
        the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant.
         They are an informal grouping within the proboscidean family Elephantidae. 
         Elephantidae is the only surviving family of proboscideans; extinct members include the mastodons. 
          Elephantidae also contains several extinct groups, including the mammoths and straight-tusked elephants.
           African elephants have larger ears and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears, and convex or level backs. 
       Distinctive features of all elephants include a long proboscis called a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, massive legs, and tough but sensitive skin.</h1>
